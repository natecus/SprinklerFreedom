# Initial Setup Guide: Unlocking and Connecting the Blossom 8

The Blossom 8 sprinkler controller was originally tied to a discontinued cloud app. Instead of tossing it, we figured out how to get it online locally and control it ourselves. Here’s the step-by-step:

---

### 1. Power up the Blossom
- Plug in the Blossom 8.  
- After a minute, it broadcasts a Wi-Fi setup network.

---

### 2. Connect to the Blossom’s setup Wi-Fi
- On your phone or pc (it works best on pc), look for an SSID named **Blossom_XXXX** (the last digits vary by device).  
- Connect to that network using the default password: 12flowers

---

### 3. Configure your home Wi-Fi
- Once connected, use ipconfig to find your default gateway, this will be the IP of the Blossom
  - On mine it was `http://192.168.4.1` but I don't know if that is default.  
- Pick your home Wi-Fi network (SSID) from the list.  
- Enter your home Wi-Fi password.  
- Save settings. The Blossom will reboot and join your home Wi-Fi.

### 4. Find the Blossom on your LAN
Now the Blossom is part of your home network. To get its IP address:  

1. **Check your router’s device list** – it usually shows up as “Blossom.”  
2. **Use SprinklerFreedom’s “Auto-Discover” button** – it scans your subnet for devices serving `/bloom.js`.  
3. **Use a network scan tool** (e.g. `nmap` or Fing).  

---

### That’s it!  
Your Blossom 8 is now unlocked, running fully on your home network, and no longer dependent on a dead cloud service.
